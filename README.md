# Drum-Kit

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for your interest in my project.

We've got a number of keys that represent different drums in a typical drum set and when you click on any of these buttons then you'll get the corresponding sound of the drum.

In addition you can also use the keys on the keyboard.

It's made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Try it!
